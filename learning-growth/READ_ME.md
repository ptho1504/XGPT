# Learning & Growth:

#### 1. Share a technical concept or tool you've recently learned. How did you approach learning it, and how have you applied this knowledge?

Recently, I have been learning about **gRPC** and **AWS Cloud** as part of improving backend and cloud-based architectures.

### **gRPC**:

**How I Approached Learning It:**
1. Read the official documentation to understand its architecture and protocol buffers.
2. Followed tutorials on implementing gRPC services in Node.js and Java.

**How I Have Applied This Knowledge:**
- Implemented a gRPC microservice architecture for efficient communication between services.
- Used protocol buffers to define structured and compact message formats.
- Improved API performance and reduced network overhead compared to REST.

### **AWS Cloud**:

**How I Approached Learning It:**
1. Explored AWS documentation and online courses.
2. Set up EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and Lambda functions for hands-on experience.


**How I Have Applied This Knowledge:**
- Deployed applications on AWS using EC2 and ECS.
- Used AWS Lambda for serverless computing to handle background tasks efficiently.
- Leveraged S3 for scalable storage and CDN distribution.

Learning gRPC and AWS Cloud has significantly improved my understanding of scalable, high-performance backend and cloud computing solutions.

#### 2. What resources do you use to stay updated with the latest developments in web technologies? 
- Blogs and News Websites
- Official Documentation
-  YouTube Channels
#### 3. Which area of full-stack development interests you most, and why?
I'm particularly interested in Backend development and DevOps because I enjoy building scalable, high-performance systems and optimizing infrastructure for reliability.
